### Criteria for Awesome Lists

To maintain a high-quality and useful collection, please ensure that any list you propose meets the following criteria:

- The list is actively maintained (recent commits or updates within the last 6–12 months).
- The list has a clear scope and purpose described in its README.
- The list follows the general principles of the “awesome” philosophy:
  - Curated content (not a random dump of links).
  - Clear categorization.
  - Concise descriptions for each entry.
- The list has a reasonable number of stars or community interest, or shows clear signs of growth.
- The list content is relevant to its category (Programming Languages or General).
- The list does not primarily exist for self-promotion.

Lists that do not meet these criteria may be rejected, even if they follow the formatting guidelines.

## Updating your Pull Request

Sometimes, a maintainer of an awesome list will ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.

[Here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) is a write up on how to change a Pull Request, and the different ways you can do that.
